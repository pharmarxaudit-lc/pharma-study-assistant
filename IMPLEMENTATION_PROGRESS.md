# Pharmacy Study Assistant - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: PDF Processing & Content Analysis ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ PDF text extraction with PyMuPDF
- ✅ Content cleaning and structuring
- ✅ Claude API integration for content analysis
- ✅ Database schema with SQLAlchemy
- ✅ Question generation (325 questions across 13 topics)
- ✅ Markdown output generation

## Phase 2A: Database & Backend API ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Database models (Document, Question, StudySession, UserAttempt)
- ✅ Question retrieval endpoints
- ✅ Session management endpoints
- ✅ Question statistics tracking
- ✅ 325 questions loaded into database

## Phase 2B: Frontend Exam Interface ✅ COMPLETE (with 1 known issue)
- ✅ Session configuration UI (SessionConfig.vue)
- ✅ Question display component (QuestionDisplay.vue)
- ✅ Results summary component (ResultsSummary.vue)
- ✅ API service layer (api.ts)
- ✅ ExamView routing and state management
- ✅ Complete exam flow (start → questions → results)
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests

### Known Issues
⚠️ **Backend datetime error in results endpoint** (app.py:736)
- Error: `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'`
- Location: `duration_seconds = int((study_session.end_time - study_session.start_time).total_seconds())`
- Root cause: SQLite stores datetime as TEXT, retrieved as strings
- Impact: Results API returns 500, but frontend still displays results page
- Fix needed: Parse datetime strings before subtraction

## Phase 3: Progress Tracking & Analytics 🔜 NOT STARTED
- ⬜ Session history view
- ⬜ Topic performance analytics
- ⬜ Difficulty progression tracking
- ⬜ Weak area identification
- ⬜ Study recommendations

## Phase 4: Study Tools & Features 🔜 NOT STARTED
- ⬜ Flashcard mode
- ⬜ Timed mock exams
- ⬜ Bookmark/favorite questions
- ⬜ Custom study sets
- ⬜ Print/export study materials

## Testing Status
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests created
- ✅ Complete exam flow verified (10 questions)
- ✅ Session start, question navigation, answer submission all working
- ⚠️ Results endpoint needs fix for datetime parsing

## Next Steps for New Session
1. Fix backend datetime parsing in `app.py:736`
2. Test full results page display with proper data
3. Implement session history view (Phase 3)
4. Add analytics dashboard
