# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Exam/Testing UI

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16
**Target Exam**: Puerto Rico Pharm.D State Law Licensure Exam
**Exam Format**: Multiple choice only, 2-3 hours

---

## Overview

Phase 2 builds an exam preparation system that generates questions from extracted PDF content and provides an interactive testing experience with progress tracking and spaced repetition.

---

## Architecture Decisions (Confirmed)

### Content Strategy
‚úÖ **Static deployment model** - All content and enrichment happens before Replit deployment
‚úÖ **Primary content source** - PR pharmacy law exam review course (111 pages, processed)
  - Contains detailed laws, regulations, case studies, examples
  - Source for question generation
‚úÖ **Secondary reference** - PR pharmacy study guide (`uploads/pr_pharmacy_study_guide.pdf`)
  - Official commission guidance on exam topics
  - Ensures comprehensive coverage of all required areas
  - Cross-reference to validate review course completeness
‚úÖ **Enhancement phase** - Optional research/enrichment step after initial testing
‚úÖ **Dynamic generation** - Hybrid approach (pre-generated + on-demand via API)

### Question Generation
‚úÖ **Question type**: Multiple choice only
- Single correct answer (4 options: A-D)
- "Choose all that apply" (2-3 correct out of 4-5 options)

‚úÖ **Generation strategy**: Hybrid approach
- Pre-generate 20-30 questions per topic during setup
- Store all in SQLite for offline access
- Use Anthropic API for additional variations on-demand
- Question variation system to prevent memorization

‚úÖ **Distractor strategy**:
- Use exam review course content + Claude's pharmacy law knowledge
- Generate plausible incorrect answers based on common misconceptions
- Include numeric variations and similar-sounding terms

### Study Session Configuration
‚úÖ **User configurable** - Settings accessible when starting a session
- **Default: 25-30 questions** per session (medium length)
- **Default: Mixed topics** to simulate exam conditions
- **User can change**:
  - Session length (short 10-15, medium 25-30, long 50+)
  - Topic mode (single topic focus vs mixed topics)
  - Difficulty filter (if desired)

### Mock Exam Configuration
‚úÖ **User configurable** - Keep it simple and flexible
- **Defaults**:
  - 50-100 questions (user selects before starting)
  - 2-3 hour time limit (user selects: 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 3 hrs)
  - 70% passing score
- **Multiple sessions**: User can take unlimited mock exams with randomized questions
- **Session history**: Track all attempts for progress review

### Deployment & Data Management
‚úÖ **No login system** - Keep it simple, single-user app
- **Database strategy**:
  - Build and populate database locally with pre-generated questions
  - Include populated SQLite file in deployment
  - Update locally, redeploy with changes as needed based on feedback
- **API key**: Store ANTHROPIC_API_KEY as Replit secret
- **Session tracking**: Full exam attempt logging with:
  - All questions asked
  - User answers
  - Correct/incorrect status
  - Timestamp, duration, score
- **Results reporting**:
  - Online results page after each exam
  - Downloadable PDF report with:
    - Full exam questions and answers
    - Correct answers highlighted in green
    - Incorrect answers highlighted in red
    - Score breakdown by topic
    - Timestamp and duration
- **Exam history**: Persistent log of all test attempts with results accessible in app

### Risk: API Costs for On-Demand Generation
- **Mitigation**: Pre-generate maximum questions, set budget alerts, monitor usage

### Risk: Database Size
- **Mitigation**: Optimize queries, add indexes, regular vacuum, pagination for large lists

### Risk: PDF Generation Performance
- **Mitigation**: Generate PDFs asynchronously, cache common reports, optimize template

### Risk: Browser Compatibility
